# Drone Control Application

This application is designed to control a drone using a graphical interface built with Tkinter and OpenCV. It provides an easy-to-use interface for executing various drone control commands such as takeoff, landing, navigation to specified coordinates, camera operations, video recording, telemetry collection, and more.

## Features

1. **Drone Control:**
   - **Takeoff and Landing:** Buttons to take off and land the drone.
   - **Move to Global and Local Coordinates:** Navigate the drone using specified coordinates.
   - **Activate Flight Plan:** Execute a pre-defined flight plan.
   - **Return Home:** Command the drone to return to its starting position.

2. **Camera:**
   - **Object Detection:** Identify objects in the camera feed.
   - **Motion Detection:** Detect moving objects.
   - **Color Detection:** Identify objects based on their color.
   - **Face Detection:** Detect faces within the camera feed.
   - **Video Recording:** Record video from the drone's camera.
   - **Stop Detection and Recording:** Stop all detection and video recording processes.

3. **Telemetry:**
   - **Telemetry Recording:** Save telemetry data such as altitude and distance.

4. **LED Control:**
   - Turn LEDs on or off on the drone.

5. **Graph Plotting:**
   - Plot graphs using telemetry data.

## Installation

### Requirements

To run this application, ensure the following libraries are installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Tkinter (included with Python's standard library)
- OpenCV for Python (`opencv-python`)
