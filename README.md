# Programming Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Python

## Overview

This repository contains projects developed as part of the "Drone Programmer in Python" training program. The course covers both theoretical aspects and practical tasks focused on programming unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using Python.

### Acquired Skills:

- Developing and debugging software code using the high-level Python programming language.
- Creating software for UAV control, including controllers and communication systems.
- Programming automatic flight and onboard computing systems.
- Testing software code and troubleshooting errors.
- Preparing technical documentation for flight operations.
- Complying with safety regulations and legal requirements in the UAV industry.

## Developed Projects

### [1. Drones Notes](https://github.com/Shustovskikh/g_unmanned_aerial_vehicle/tree/main/1_drones_notes)

### [4. Drone Route Calculator](https://github.com/Shustovskikh/g_unmanned_aerial_vehicle/4_drone_route_calculator)

**Description:** An application for calculating UAV routes based on user-inputted start, end, and intermediate coordinates. A graphical interface is used for convenience.

**Technologies:** Python, Tkinter.

---

### [5. Drone Control App Project](https://github.com/Shustovskikh/g_unmanned_aerial_vehicle/5_drone_control_app_project)

**Description:** A fully functional software application for drone control via a graphical interface. It supports takeoff, landing, movement control, camera operation, video recording, telemetry, and other features.

**Technologies:** Python, Tkinter, OpenCV.
